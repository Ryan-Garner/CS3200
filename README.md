# CS3200
Final Project for CS 32000
## Instagram Functionality
Instagram is really strict with permissions so as the app currently stands only those added to the sandbox mode of the app
have access to the instagram functionality until it is aproved by instagrams and goes live.
Which as of right now myself and my roommate are the only ones with access to this functionality.
